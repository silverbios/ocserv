### The following directives do not change with server reload.

# User authentication method. To require multiple methods to be
# used for the user to login, add multiple auth directives. The values
# in the 'auth' directive are AND composed (if multiple all must
# succeed).
# Available options: certificate, plain, pam, radius, gssapi.
# Note that authentication methods utilizing passwords cannot be
# combined (e.g., the plain, pam or radius methods).

# certificate:
#  This indicates that all connecting users must present a certificate.
#  The username and user group will be then extracted from it (see
#  cert-user-oid and cert-group-oid). The certificate to be accepted
#  it must be signed by the CA certificate as specified in 'ca-cert' and
#  it must not be listed in the CRL, as specified by the 'crl' option.
#
# pam[gid-min=1000]:
#  This enabled PAM authentication of the user. The gid-min option is used
# by auto-select-group option, in order to select the minimum valid group ID.
#
# plain[passwd=/etc/ocserv/ocpasswd,otp=/etc/ocserv/users.otp]
#  The plain option requires specifying a password file which contains
# entries of the following format.
# "username:groupname1,groupname2:encoded-password"
# One entry must be listed per line, and 'ocpasswd' should be used
# to generate password entries. The 'otp' suboption allows one to specify
# an oath password file to be used for one time passwords; the format of
# the file is described in https://github.com/archiecobbs/mod-authn-otp/wiki/UsersFile
#
# radius[config=/etc/radiusclient/radiusclient.conf,groupconfig=true,nas-identifier=name]:
#  The radius option requires specifying freeradius-client configuration
# file. If the groupconfig option is set, then config-per-user/group will be overridden,
# and all configuration will be read from radius. That also includes the
# Acct-Interim-Interval, and Session-Timeout values.
#
# See doc/README-radius.md for the supported radius configuration atributes.
#
# gssapi[keytab=/etc/key.tab,require-local-user-map=true,tgt-freshness-time=900]
#  The gssapi option allows one to use authentication methods supported by GSSAPI,
# such as Kerberos tickets with ocserv. It should be best used as an alternative
# to PAM (i.e., have pam in auth and gssapi in enable-auth), to allow users with
# tickets and without tickets to login. The default value for require-local-user-map
# is true. The 'tgt-freshness-time' if set, it would require the TGT tickets presented
# to have been issued within the provided number of seconds. That option is used to
# restrict logins even if the KDC provides long time TGT tickets.

# Accounting methods available:
# radius: can be combined with any authentication method, it provides
#      radius accounting to available users (see also stats-report-time).
#
# pam: can be combined with any authentication method, it provides
#      a validation of the connecting user's name using PAM. It is
#      superfluous to use this method when authentication is already
#      PAM.
